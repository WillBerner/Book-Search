## Description :

Book Search is a MERN stack book search engine using Google's Books API. Users can register an account, login, and are then able to both save an delete certain books from their account. Book search implements GraphQL instead of a more traditional RESTful API for its CRUD functionality. All authorization and authenication used in the application was handled with JSON Web Tokens (JWTs).

## Usage :

Users can immediately search books via Google's Books API, but must be logged in to save books. Users can log in via the navbar of the webpage, or can register themselves and create a new account if they don't already have one. After logging in, users can use the "Save this Book!" button on books that they've search for from the searching page. Users can also view books that they've saved by clicking on the "See Your Books" page via the navbar. From this page, users can delete any book that they've saved and no longer need to remember.
